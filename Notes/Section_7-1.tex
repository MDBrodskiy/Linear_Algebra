\begin{itemize}

  \item Eigenvalues are denoted by the Greek letter lambda ($\lambda$)

  \item Let $\bold{A}$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. The scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue of $\bold{A}$ when $\in\overrightarrow{x}\neq0$ such that $\bold{A}\overrightarrow{x}=\lambda\overrightarrow{x}$

  \item Let $\bold{A}$ be $n\times n$

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item An eigenvalue of $\bold{A}$ is a scalar $\lambda$ such that $|\lambda\bold{I}-\bold{A}|=0$

      \item Eigenvectors of $\bold{A}$ corresponding to $\lambda$ are non-zero solutions of $(\lambda\bold{I}-\bold{A})\overrightarrow{x}=\overrightarrow{0}$

      \item $p(\lambda)=|\lambda\bold{I}-\bold{A}|=0$ is the characteristic equation

    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
